## Release Notes

### 🎯 What is TrustChain?

TrustChain is a comprehensive framework for creating cryptographically signed AI tool responses to prevent hallucinations and ensure authenticity. Every tool response is automatically signed with cryptographic proof, making it impossible to tamper with or forge AI outputs.

### 🔐 Key Benefits

- **Prevents AI Hallucinations** - Cryptographic proof ensures response authenticity
- **Zero Trust Architecture** - Never trust, always verify
- **Developer Friendly** - Add trust with just a decorator: `@TrustedTool("my_tool")`
- **Production Ready** - Comprehensive testing and error handling
- **High Performance** - Sub-millisecond overhead for most operations
- **Scalable** - From single tools to enterprise deployments

### 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from trustchain import TrustedTool

@TrustedTool("my_api")
async def my_trusted_api(data: str) -> dict:
    return {"processed": data, "timestamp": time.time()}

# Every response is automatically signed and verifiable!
response = await my_trusted_api("hello world")
print(f"Verified: {response.is_verified}")
print(f"Signature: {response.signature.signature[:20]}...")
```

### 📊 Tested and Verified

- ✅ **15/15 core tests** passing
- ✅ **100% basic functionality** working
- ✅ **CLI tools** fully operational
- ✅ **Performance optimized** (0.17ms per operation)
- ✅ **Memory efficient** with optional caching
- ✅ **Production ready** error handling
